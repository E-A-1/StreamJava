In Java, FileWriter, FileOutputStream, and BufferedWriter are classes used for writing data to files, but they have some key differences in terms of functionality and usage.

FileWriter:

FileWriter is a class in the java.io package that writes characters to a file.
It is primarily used for writing text data to a file, providing a convenient way to write characters to a file one at a time or in chunks.
It internally uses the platform's default character encoding.
Example usage:
java

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
writer.write("Hello, World!");
writer.close();

FileOutputStream:

FileOutputStream is a class in the java.io package that writes raw bytes to a file.
It is used for writing all types of data, including binary data, to a file.
It does not perform any character encoding and writes data in the form of bytes.
Example usage:
java

FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("filename.txt");
byte[] data = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111}; // "Hello"
outputStream.write(data);
outputStream.close();

BufferedWriter:

BufferedWriter is a class in the java.io package that writes text efficiently to a character-output stream, such as a file.
It wraps an existing Writer (such as FileWriter) and provides methods for writing characters or strings to the output stream.
It improves performance by buffering the data and reducing the number of I/O operations.
Example usage:
java

FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(fileWriter);
bufferedWriter.write("Hello, World!");
bufferedWriter.close();
In summary, FileWriter and FileOutputStream are used for writing characters and raw bytes to a file, respectively. On the other hand, BufferedWriter is used for writing text efficiently by buffering the output and is commonly used with FileWriter to write characters or strings to a file.
